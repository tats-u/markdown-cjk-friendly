## Non-emoji General-use Variation Selectors

- U+FE00..U+FE0E

## EAW is treated as "W" if unassigned (defined by Unicode)

> [!NOTE]
> The following result is extracted from https://www.unicode.org/Public/{{{ unicodeVersionWithPatch }}}/ucd/EastAsianWidth.txt. It is slightly different from https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/#Unassigned. U+2FFFE, U+2FFFF, U+3FFFE, and U+3FFFF are missing, but [they are "Noncharacter"](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode{{{ unicodeVersionWithPatch }}}/core-spec/chapter-23/#G19653), not ["Unassigned" (or "Reserved")](https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#reserved_code_point). This shows that we do not have to care about whether they are included in the list of CJK code points or not. To simplify the ranges, U+2FFFE and U+2FFFF are merged to U+20000–U+2FFFD here.

- U+3400..U+4DBF (㐀..䶿)
- U+4E00..U+9FFF (一..鿿)
- U+F900..U+FAFF (豈..﫿)
- U+20000..U+3FFFD (𠀀..𿿽)

## CJK ambiguous punctuation sequences

- U+2018 U+FE01 (‘︁)
- U+2019 U+FE01 (’︁)
- U+201C U+FE01 (“︁)
- U+201D U+FE01 (”︁)

## (for discussion for the future) Emojis derived from CJK symbols (can be switched to text symbol by U+FE0E)

> [!NOTE]
> These characters are currently treated as emojis (=non-CJK) even if they are followed by U+FE0E.
>
> Some of them may need to be treated as CJK in the future if they are followed by U+FE0E.
>
> All of their East Asian Widths are `W`.
